# Investment_Portfolio_Rebalance

This project was created for personal purpose to rebalance my own investment porfolio throught its different kinds of categories (Brazilian Stocks, Brazilian FIIs, US REITS, US Stocks and Cash). Based on a previous set ratio for each categories and inputs for the available cash in the portfolio, the user will input the amount of investment he or she will make. The output is the ideal amount of investment for each category, respecting the previous proportions set.
